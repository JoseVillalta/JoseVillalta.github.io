Containers provide the ability to package, deploy and reuse applications using a natural isolation boundary. Developers can expose application-specific functionality as interfaces as well as more generic hooks for many systems like metrics, health, etc.
In this paper the authors present the readers with two types of container design patterns: Patterns for container in the same machine (Single node) and patterns where the containers are spread out in different machines (multi node)</description></item><item><title>Paper every day. Day Two: Kubernetes</title><link>https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-two-k8s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 06:33:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-two-k8s/</guid><description>Welcome to day 2 of my paper-every-day journey. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover Borg, Omega and Kubernetes This paper goes over how Kubernetes, the de-facto, open-source orchestrator of containers was developed using the lessons learned from building Borg and Omega, Google&amp;rsquo;s internal job orchestrator.
Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that aims to make developing and deploying complex distributed systems easier. The Borg and Omega papers are excellent papers on their own right, but this explanation original published in ACM Queue is very insightful.</description></item><item><title>Goal: A Paper Every Day.

I am doing this in order to get better at my craft. I want to be better at designing software and it has been shown in research that the people who are really good at what they do are those that do &amp;ldquo;delibarate practice&amp;rdquo; I am most definitely NOT the best software system designer out there, but talent is overated and I intend to improve my knowledge one day at time.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://JoseVillalta.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://JoseVillalta.github.io/about/</guid><description>Life Story I was born in Venezuela and moved to Florida when I was 13, I went to the Marines right after high school.
