Today&rsquo;s paper comes thanks to Will Larson this is a recommended paper in his book Elegant Puzzle
This paper builds on the concepts from the the CAP Theorem which essentially says that when it comes to distributed systems you can only have 2 out of these 3 qualities:


Consistency


Avalaibility


Partition Tolerance


Then it introduces two concepts harvest and yield which is interesting because it&rsquo;s not something you usually hear in distributed systems (this is a paper from the &rsquo;90s) and yet I think it&rsquo;s import to know and to think in these terms."><meta name=author content="Jose Villalta"><link rel=canonical href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-four-harvest-yield/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.48a18943c2fc15c38a372b8dde1f5e5dc0bc64fa6cb90f5a817d2f8c76b7f3ae.css integrity="sha256-SKGJQ8L8FcOKNyuN3h9eXcC8ZPpsuQ9agX0vjHa3864=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.2eadbb982468c11a433a3e291f01326f2ba43f065e256bf792dbd79640a92316.js integrity="sha256-Lq27mCRowRpDOj4pHwEybyukPwZeJWv3ktvXlkCpIxY=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-four-harvest-yield/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Paper every day.
