This thing you want to make is composed of many parts. There’s the car itself made up of many subparts (engine, tires, transmission, etc) as well as the AI tech. Realistically you will need a bunch of speciallized embedded systems as well as a central computer to orchestrate everything.

How do you know how fast the visual recognition needs to be to handle controlling a car going 60 mph?\nIt turns out that complexity can make or break your design. This book offers a mental model you can use to create abstractions that make reasoning about complex phenomena easier: The system. It turns out you can model a lot of natural and artificial systems by thinking about Stocks, Flows and Dynamic Equilibrium.\nThis tool will help you analyze complex systems to find bottlenecks. It helps you reason about the trade-offs in the design. You can use the system domain to communicate the behaviour and structure of your system using a shared language.\nI took these notes while reading the book\nSummary of System Principles System\nA system is more than the sum of its parts Many interconnections work through the flow of information The least obvious parts of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time. Stocks, Flows and Dynamic Equilibrium\nA stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system If the sum of inflows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock level will rise If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of inflows, the stock level will fall Stock levels stay the same when there is dynamic equilibrium. The stock inflows are equat to the stock outflows Stock can be increased two ways, decrease its output flow or increase its input flow Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorvers in systems Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and independent Feedback Loops\nBalancing feedback loops are equilibrating. They provide stability of resistance to change Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing. It can give you exponential growth or runaway collapse Shifting Dominance, Delays and Oscillations\nDelays in feedback makes oscillations Scenarios and Testing Models\nSystem dynamics ask “what if” questions Constraints on Systems\nNo system can grow forever. There must be a reinforcing loop driving growth and a balancing loop constraining the growth Nonrenewable resources are stock limited Renewable resoruces are flow limited Resilience, Self-Organization and Hierarchy\nThere are always limits to resilience Systems need to be managed for resilience as well as productivity and stability Hierarchichal systems evolve from the bottom up Source of System Surprises\nMany relationships in systems are non-linear There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion At any given time, the input that is most importan to a system is the one that is most limiting Any physical entitiy with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by layers of limits. There will always be limits to growth When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight is essential The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole Mindset and Models\nEverything we think we know about the world is a model Our models do have a strong congruence with the world Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully. Springing the System Traps Policy Resistance\nAdding policy can sometimes have unintended consequences. Need to let go. The Tragedy of the Commons\nThe actors overause a shared resource when there is a weak feedback between the use and the consequences. Fix is to educate, also reinforce the feedback link. Drift to low performance\nAllowing performance standards to be influenced by past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals. Fix is to keep performance and standards absolute.\nEscalation\nWhen the state is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock -and vice versa- then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race. The way out is to avoid getting in it or refuse to compete.\nSuccess to the Successful\nThe winners of a competition are systematically rewarded with the means to win again. The way out: Diversify\nShifting the Burden to the Intervenor\nShifting the burden, addiction arise when a solution to a systematic problem reduces or disguises the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Way out: Don’t get in. Focus on the long term.\nRule Beating\nRules to govern a system can lead to rule-beating, perverse behavior that gives the appearance of obeying the rules or achieving the goals, but that actually distorts the systems. Way out: redesign the system.\nSeeking the Wrong Goal\nSystem may work to produce a result that is not intended and wanted. Specify indicators that reflect the real welfare of the system. Do not confuse effort with result.\nPlaces to Intervene in a System Sorted by effectiveness 12 Numbers\n11 Buffers\n10 Stock-and-Flow Structures\n9 Delays\n8 Balancing Feedback Loops\n7 Reinforcing Feedback Loops\n6 Information Flows\n5 Rules\n4 Self-Organization\n3 Goals\n2 Paradigms\n1 Transcending Paradigms\nGuidelines for Living in a World of Systems Get the beat of the system\nExpose your mental models to the light of day\nHonor, respect and distribute information\nUse language with care and enrich it with system concepts\nPay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifyiable\nMake feedback policies for feedback systems\nGo for the good of the whole\nListen to the wisdom of the system\nLocate responsibility within the system\nStay humble, stay a learner\nCelebrate complexity\nExpand time horizons\nDefy the disciplines\nExpand the boundary of caring\nDon’t erode the goal of goodness\n","wordCount":"1023","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://JoseVillalta.github.io/img/ThinkingInSystems.jpg","datePublished":"2023-11-04T16:18:25-07:00","dateModified":"2023-11-04T16:18:25-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/systems-book-notes/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yes Way Jose","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Yes Way Jose (Alt + H)">Yes Way Jose</a>
