Omega was the second cluster manager system built by Google. It is Borg&rsquo;s sucessor and it was designed as a happy medium between Borg&rsquo;s centralized scheduler architecture and Mesos&rsquo;s two-level approach where the placement is delegated to the running framework. Omega shares the state of the cluster among leaders and uses optimistic concurrency control (detect when different cluster schedulers are competing for the same resource)
The premise of the whole paper is that a centralized scheduler does not scale well, so there must be a better way to handle scheduling different types of workloads in a fast and conrrect manner."><meta name=author content="Jose Villalta"><link rel=canonical href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-eight-omega/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.48a18943c2fc15c38a372b8dde1f5e5dc0bc64fa6cb90f5a817d2f8c76b7f3ae.css integrity="sha256-SKGJQ8L8FcOKNyuN3h9eXcC8ZPpsuQ9agX0vjHa3864=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.30d2332871da51f600f574811c17751e6c862577d450b624f86e2bc8a6e31221.js integrity="sha256-MNIzKHHaUfYA9XSBHBd1HmyGJXfUULYk+G4ryKbjEiE=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Paper every day.
