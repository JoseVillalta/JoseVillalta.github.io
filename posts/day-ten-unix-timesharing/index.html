This paper, published in July 1974 is remarkable because the design decisions that were made back then by these guys working at Bell Labs on an operating system for the PDP-11 are still relevant.
I am still struggling to create a mental model of the unix file system, the fact that it looks like a single tree with the root at the top while simultaneously you can have multiple devices mounted dates back to these guys at Bell Labs."><meta name=author content="Jose Villalta"><link rel=canonical href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/day-ten-unix-timesharing/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.48a18943c2fc15c38a372b8dde1f5e5dc0bc64fa6cb90f5a817d2f8c76b7f3ae.css integrity="sha256-SKGJQ8L8FcOKNyuN3h9eXcC8ZPpsuQ9agX0vjHa3864=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.30d2332871da51f600f574811c17751e6c862577d450b624f86e2bc8a6e31221.js integrity="sha256-MNIzKHHaUfYA9XSBHBd1HmyGJXfUULYk+G4ryKbjEiE=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Paper every Day.
