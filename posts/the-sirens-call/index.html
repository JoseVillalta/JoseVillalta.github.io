<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Book Review
I&rsquo;m almost finished with The Siren&rsquo;s Call by Chris Hayes
and it&rsquo;s interesting enough to call out here.
The book starts with an excellent explanation of what attention is and how it works. Then the book presents two analogies to use when thinking about attention.
The first one is to think of Attention as a resource that drives the economy, like labor, it is commodified, it can be monetized, marketed bought and sold.
Since information is now pletiful, (there&rsquo;s too much of it, really) attention is scarce, we have a limit of how much information we consume, how much we can pay attention to.
So now market forces, tech companies, politicians they are all competing for our attention. Our attention has value, it yields money, power and fame."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/the-sirens-call/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.48a18943c2fc15c38a372b8dde1f5e5dc0bc64fa6cb90f5a817d2f8c76b7f3ae.css integrity="sha256-SKGJQ8L8FcOKNyuN3h9eXcC8ZPpsuQ9agX0vjHa3864=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.2eadbb982468c11a433a3e291f01326f2ba43f065e256bf792dbd79640a92316.js integrity="sha256-Lq27mCRowRpDOj4pHwEybyukPwZeJWv3ktvXlkCpIxY=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/the-sirens-call/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="The Sirens Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource"><meta property="og:description" content="Book Review
