Welcome to day 2 of my paper-every-day journey. Today we&rsquo;re going to cover Borg, Omega and Kubernetes This paper goes over how Kubernetes, the de-facto, open-source orchestrator of containers was developed using the lessons learned from building Borg and Omega, Google&rsquo;s internal job orchestrator.
Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that aims to make developing and deploying complex distributed systems easier.
The Borg and Omega papers are excellent papers on their own right, but this explanation original published in ACM Queue is very insightful.
