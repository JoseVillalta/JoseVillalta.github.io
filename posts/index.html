The corporate-speak term we use at Amazon is the Leadership Principle of “Right A Lot”
For me it’s about having a scientific mindset, or more plainly, constantly wondering, “how does this work?” “Why are things working this way, instead of that way?” or my favority “What would happen if I dod this” but wondering and inquiring is not the whole thing, is actively working to disconfirm your beliefs. It’s about being open to the possibility that you might be wrong. I love that.

The book starts with an excellent explanation of what attention is and how it works. Then the book presents two analogies to use when thinking about attention.
The first one is to think of Attention as a resource that drives the economy, like labor, it is commodified, it can be monetized, marketed bought and sold. Since information is now pletiful, (there’s too much of it, really) attention is scarce, we have a limit of how much information we consume, how much we can pay attention to. So now market forces, tech companies, politicians they are all competing for our attention. Our attention has value, it yields money, power and fame.

The answer is simple, but not always easy</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>This week I had an Eureka moment at work. You see, there are many things I see at work that I would like to improve. Technical debt in our codebase. Inefficient processes. Communication silos across teams. The list of things one can improve never ends, this is true in all software shops. System complixity grows as new functionality gets added, inefficiencies optimized, bugs fixed. Secuirty hardened, etc.
How do you increase the quality of your system without interrupting the flow? Well, obviously, you break it up, one tiny thing at time. That’s how. Yeah it’s obvious but (this is embarrasing to admit) I get the urge to make BIG changes, I’d like to rewrite whole chuncks of the codebase, I’d like to build a brand new release pipeline, and we might do that someday, but not today. When you have a team that’s busy doing the work, tidying up gets deprioritized. After all, that bug in prod needs to get fixed yesterday, that new feature needs to ship on time. Oh, by the way, the developer that was working on that thing your system depends on quit last week.

Unlike many people in my team, I remember the day Google announced go. I don’t remember if it was in Hacker News or /programming reddit, but I do remember watching the go math package compiling in less than a second, at the time, I was writing C++ for an embedded system. Building the whole model as we used to say took 45 minutes, this compiled our C/C++ project into a .out file for an ARM9 and a C55 DSP. When I saw how quickly Go built I was like, wow. To be fair, our build was for a Real Time OS so it didn’t even include the C++ standard library. Most of the time, if I remember right, was spent linking everything. THe linker was getting it’s poor butt kicked. Anyyway, I looked at Rob Pike (?) on YouTube and I was like,

The Code we write is a representation of the things we believe are true about the world. Every one has just one name, right? Well, most of the time, yes. All of the time? No. If you write an app for yourself, or your small business most of these assumptions are fine. If you write code for millions of users, you are going to find exceptions. Some of them surprise me. Dealing with Time sucks, dealing with addresses, names, supporting multiple languages it’s really hard to get it right 100% of the time.

This thing you want to make is composed of many parts. There’s the car itself made up of many subparts (engine, tires, transmission, etc) as well as the AI tech. Realistically you will need a bunch of speciallized embedded systems as well as a central computer to orchestrate everything. There’s sensors, actuators, orchestrators, etc. In short, how does one person know if a design is good? How do you know how fast the visual recognition needs to be to handle controlling a car going 60 mph?
