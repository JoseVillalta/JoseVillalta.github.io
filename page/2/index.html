B waits while A runs then A yields to B and A waits while B runs. It turns out this is useful in a few scenarios.

Three Easy Pieces” by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.
I used to think that I knew how file systems worked because the interface open, read and write is so straight forward, what else could there be to it? But then at work some weird issues come up where some weird behaviour happens, like, du says the disk has space but df says the disk is full, what could make that happen? Or when an issue mounting a volume occurs and you realize that you don’t know the difference between mounting a block device versus mounting a file system. Are they both the same thing? I need to have a mental model of what the system is doing in order to debug it. Knowing the data structures in the file system and having an idea of what happens when you open a file, how does the operating system find the file? how does it traverse the file tree? What is in memory versus disk? I must confess I am still in the dark when it comes to container images and union file systems. I understand how a container is made up of many layers over imposed on top of each other. An image is essentially a tar file of different file systems on top of each other. But, how is it implemented? how do you, can you just put a whole other /proc and other system files on top of a kernel? So anyway, that’s what I have been up to.</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>&lt;span title='2023-07-15 21:21:31 -0700 -0700'>July 15, 2023&lt;/span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Learning File Systems" href=https://JoseVillalta.github.io/posts/learning-file-systems/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>My Tsundoku Pile</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>I’m trying to get through all my technical books that I’ve adquired, and never gotten around to.

This paper, published in July 1974 is remarkable because the design decisions that were made back then by these guys working at Bell Labs on an operating system for the PDP-11 are still relevant.
I am still struggling to create a mental model of the unix file system, the fact that it looks like a single tree with the root at the top while simultaneously you can have multiple devices mounted dates back to these guys at Bell Labs.

From the abstract:
“This paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications running on Linux on a 48-core computer…using mostly standard parallel programming techniques -this paper introduces one new technique sloppy counters these bottlencek can be removed from the kernl or avoided by changing the application slightly”
This paper has an excellent system level tutorial on scalability. They explain that you don’t get linear increase in performance because in real life applications parallel tasks usually interact, an interaction forces serial execution. Then they list the common causes with common solutions. This paper is throughly written and researched. Writing truly parallel code is difficult and even then applications still compete for some shared resouce, be it a local cache, network access or disk I/O.

Day Eight. Omega: flexible scalable scheduler for large compute clusters</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>Omega Link to paper
Omega was the second cluster manager system built by Google. It is Borg’s sucessor and it was designed as a happy medium between Borg’s centralized scheduler architecture and Mesos’s two-level approach where the placement is delegated to the running framework. Omega shares the state of the cluster among leaders and uses optimistic concurrency control (detect when different cluster schedulers are competing for the same resource)
The premise of the whole paper is that a centralized scheduler does not scale well, so there must be a better way to handle scheduling different types of workloads in a fast and conrrect manner. The two main types of workloads, services and batches have different requriements and present their unique challenges. The paper explains the type of simulations the engineer at Google used to determine that conflicts among different scheduler is not that common and that Omega manages to fit more tasks in the clusters than Mesos.
