### Book Review: The Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly

Tanya Reilly gives a guide for individual contributor software engineers who wish to grow their career but do not want to become managers. It gives insights about what a staff engineer does, and what you need to do to perform at that level. This is a technology-agnostic book. It gives the reader a high level view of the functional areas that matter. 

I think every software engineer should read this book.
