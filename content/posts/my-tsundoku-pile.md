I'm trying to get through all my technical books that I've adquired, and never gotten around to. 
Not going to lie, the Knuth books are intimidating. They are actually not that bad to get through, but they are books that I pick up, read a few pages on a specfic project, try to do a problem or two, and that's it. 

The other books are less intimidating, more doable, I'm pretty sure al but one of these books were lying around the Amazon campus just sitting on shelves. 

Anyway, I'm trying to make myself write again but there's so much going on all the time, every time I try to start I get distracted or interrupted.
