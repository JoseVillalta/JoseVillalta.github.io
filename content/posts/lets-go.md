### Go

I have been writing go since a little after last year. I actually remember hearing about go when it first came out, back then I honestly never thought I'd be getting paid to work in it. 

Even though I've been writing code in go for a while, I don't think I know the language in enough depth to consider myself a go expert. I want to change that. So I am going to start writing about go here as a way to "learn in public"
Expect posts on the following topics:

- Is Go an OOP language? (I think so, yes)
- How does go do concurrency?
- What makes go different?
- How do you structure functionality in go?
- When do you use pointers in function declarations?
- How do you write go-ideomatic code?

And much more, hopefully.
