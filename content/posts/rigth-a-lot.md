I'm lucky that I get to work with people who are good at what they do. 
The corporate-speak term we use at Amazon is the Leadership Principle of "Right A Lot"

For me it's about having a scientific mindset, or more plainly, constantly wondering, "how does this work?"
"Why are things working this way, instead of that way?" or my favority "What would happen if I dod this"
but wondering and inquiring is not the whole thing, is actively working to disconfirm your beliefs. 
It's about being open to the possibility that you might be wrong. I love that. 

When you seek multiple viewpoints, see different perspectives, get others to weigh in. Use data for your decisions, 
look for data that will make you wrong. Be willing to change your mind. When you have that attitude and you combine it 
with a drive to expand your knowledge and expertise it's a powerful thing. 

How can this go wrong?
If being right is more important than getting things done, then there's a problem. You don't want to run into the dreaded "analysis paralysis"
You need to both be right a lot, dive deep but also have bias for action and deliver results. The former two are in tension with the latter two.
The trick is knowing how to find the right balance for you. 

Anyway, 
I'm writing this, because (yeah, this is a little hard to admit) I just kinda sorta embarrased myself when testing a change I made at work. 
This one particular thing required more changes than I had anticipated, and well I wrote a bug that luckily was plainly obvious when you test it in 
the Gamma environment. The thing is, I was so sure that my change was working...that I reached out to the whole team asking if they had a bug in their system. 
But no, the bug was mine, I wrote it. It's a bad sign when making a change for feature A, breaks an unrelated feature B. This could be a sign of a brittle desing, 
maybe I am not done refactoring this particular component. Oh well, that's why test. Still, this episode makes me want to do better next time.
