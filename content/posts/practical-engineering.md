## Practical Engineering by Peng Zhang

I want to give a quick shout out to Peng's blog [peng.fyi](peng.fyi)
Peng works with me writing software for AWS Fargate's Dataplane. I have been following his posts the last few days and I really like this blog
because:

- Technical topics that apply to most folks in my team
- His posts are short and to the point. 
- He illustrates his points with code. 
- The code is formatted with beautifcul syntax highlits that makes it easy to read. 
- I get inspired myself to share my insights in writing. 


Thanks Peng!
