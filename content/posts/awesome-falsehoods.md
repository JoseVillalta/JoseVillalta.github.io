### A curated list of falsehoods programmers believe in. 


The Code we write is a representation of the things we believe are true about the world. Every one has just one name, right? Well, most of the time, yes. All of the time? No. If you write an app for yourself, or your small business most of these assumptions are fine. If you write code for millions of users, you are going to find exceptions. Some of them surprise me. Dealing with Time sucks, dealing with addresses, names, supporting multiple languages it's really hard to get it right 100% of the time. 

This curated list in github is a good resource for things that get you to think about things you usually assume are always true, but they aren't.
