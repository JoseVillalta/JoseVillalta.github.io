## About Me

I'm Jose Villalta, an infrastructure engineer at Amazon Web Services building the systems that power millions of containerized workloads. I maintain the Fargate agent - the data plane that creates and manages serverless containers at AWS scale.

### My Path to Infrastructure

My career has been about building systems that work when it matters most. I spent seven years at Motorola writing embedded software for P25 radios - the devices that first responders depend on when lives are on the line. Police and firefighters still use radios running code I helped build.

At Impinj, I made the jump from embedded systems to distributed infrastructure. I built factory test software for RFID chips and led the transformation from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to Docker-based microservices. This is where I fell in love with containers and the problems they solve at scale.

Before that, I interned at IBM on ASIC design teams, writing Perl scripts that generated test cases from chip specifications. I learned the Linux command line there, and I'm still learning.

My technical foundation: Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Florida Atlantic University (2006), Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Florida (2011), both earned while working full time. I've never stopped learning since.

### Before Software

Before I became an engineer, I was a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps Infantry, stationed at Camp Lejeune and deployed around the world. After the Marines, I joined the Florida Army National Guard as a reservist while working full time as a bank teller and going to college at night. I was deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004 with the 124th Infantry (Florida National Guard).

I am American by choice - born in Venezuela, moved to Florida at 13, joined the Marines right after high school in 1998. I got married in 2002 to an amazing woman. My daughters were born in 2005 and 2007, and they transformed my life. I moved to Seattle in 2014. I have two bulldogs, Chicha and Petunia, who rule the house.

### What Drives Me

I build reliable infrastructure because I learned what "mission-critical" means in the Marines - when systems fail, people get hurt. I think about who technology serves because I've navigated systems not built for people like me. I care about sustainability because technical decisions at AWS scale have planetary impact.

I believe in democracy, liberty, and justice for all. I prefer hard truths over comfortable lies. Black Lives Matter.

### Outside of Work

I love to read - philosophy, science, math, history, and anything about software and systems. I ski with my youngest daughter as often as I can. I love a good baseball game. I cry at the end of good movies. I'm interested in how things work and why they matter - whether that's container orchestration, democratic institutions, or the universe itself.
