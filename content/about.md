I am a Software Engineer at Amazon, working on the [AWS ECS Fargate Dataplane.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/under-the-hood-fargate-data-plane/)

Prior to Amazon, I worked at [Impinj](https://www.impinj.com/), a startup (at the time) that makes RFID chips. I worked on the software that tests the chips at the factory. This is where I made the jump from writing embedded software (C++, Wireless signal concepts) to Web Services (Ruby on Rail Applications backed by a MS-SQL Database) I learned about Containers here. I led the effort to break up a monolith back-end application into smaller, manageble microservices. We used Docker. 

Before that I was an embedded software engineer at Motorola (Today Motorola Solutions) working on software-defined radios. I worked on the RF control layer that runs the radios for first responders (Police and Firefighters). The [APX P25 Radios](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/products/p25-products/apx-story.html) run on software I worked on. 

During college I was an intern (Co-op Program) for IBM. I was on the team that designed chips (ASIC Design) for the big servers. The team I was on wrote Verilog and VHDL. I wrote Perl scripts that parsed specs and generated test cases. This is where I learned to use the Linux Command Line. (I'm still learning) 

Before I become a softare developer I worked full time as a bank teller and part time as a Reservist in the Florida Army National Guard. Before that I was a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps Infantry stationed in Camp Lejuned but deployed all over the world.
